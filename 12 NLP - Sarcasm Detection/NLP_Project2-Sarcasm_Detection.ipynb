Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting\n","sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.\n","\n","In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a model to detect whether a sentence\n","is sarcastic or not, using Bidirectional LSTMs.\n","\n","#### Data Description:\n","\n","News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection. The dataset is collected from two\n","news websites, theonion.com and huffingtonpost.com. This new dataset has the\n","following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets:\n","\n","Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are\n","no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also\n","increases the chance of finding pre-trained embedding.\n","\n","Furthermore, since the sole purpose of TheOnion is to publish sarcastic news, we\n","get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets.\n","Unlike tweets that reply to other tweets, the news headlines obtained are self-\n","contained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements\n","\n","##### Content\n","\n","Each record consists of three attributes:\n","    - is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0\n","    - headline: the headline of the news article\n","    - article_link: link to the original news article.
